# Holy stonking piles of cheese, Batman

It's always horrible when a man in his 40's tries to be funny. Being around me is much like that, apparently. In the words of one friend, he's less ashamed by being around me than curious about why he continues to be there.

I'm here to learn. Then use. Like a teenager with his first copy of the Kama Sutra.

You'll have seen in me in that great movie "Learning .NET and its wily ways", playing the guy who works through C# and ASP while being flabbergasted by Azure. Currently looking at MVC and learning how to implement Bootstrap in bespoke ways (if feasible).

Confession: my previous form of source control was comments.
